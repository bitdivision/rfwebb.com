I"î<p>Sous-vide cooking involves sealing food inside a bag (generally in a vacuum) and immersing the bag in a water bath at a carefully controlled temperature. Generally the water bath is kept at a fairly low temeperature â€“ around 60 Â°C. By using such a low temperature it is possible to cook the item to an even temperature throughout, so a steak could be cooked to medium all the way through and then seared on the outside to give a result like the picture shown at the top of this page.</p>
