I"-<p>I recently used the <em>free</em> <a href="http://www.spiritcircuits.com/services/go-naked" title="The Go Naked Prototyping Service">‘Go Naked’</a> service from Spirit Circuits to produce a prototype PCB used in a <a href="http://localhost:4000/projects/sous-vide-part-1/" title="Sous-Vide Controller Part 1 – Design">sous-vide controller</a>. Overall I was extremely satisfied with the service, although I couldn’t quite believe it was actually free to begin with, so hopefully this short review will give others an idea of what to expect.</p>
