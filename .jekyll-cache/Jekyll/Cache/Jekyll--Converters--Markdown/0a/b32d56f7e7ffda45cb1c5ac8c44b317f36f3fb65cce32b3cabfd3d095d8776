<p>I recently used the <em>free</em> <a href="http://www.spiritcircuits.com/services/go-naked" title="The Go Naked Prototyping Service">â€˜Go Nakedâ€™</a> service from Spirit Circuits to produce a prototype PCB used in a <a href="http://localhost:4000/projects/sous-vide-part-1/" title="Sous-Vide Controller Part 1 â€“ Design">sous-vide controller</a>. Overall I was extremely satisfied with the service, although I couldnâ€™t quite believe it was actually free to begin with, so hopefully this short review will give others an idea of what to expect.</p>

<p>Having previously used their PCB Snap service, I knew that Spirit Circuits produced high quality boards however given the price of these prototypes, I was worried the quality wouldnâ€™t be great. Luckily I was proved wrong. After enquiring about the service I was given the following information about the board specifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Min Track â€“ 5 thou â€“ 0.127 mm</li>
  <li>Gap â€“ 5 thou â€“ 0.127 mm</li>
  <li>Annular â€“ 5 Thou â€“ 0.127 mm</li>
  <li>Minimum Hole size â€“ 0.3 mm</li>
  <li>Minimum Annulus â€“ 5 thou â€“ 0.127 mm</li>
  <li>Max size (FR4): 406 mm x 457 mm</li>
</ul>

<p>The boards have no routing, soldermask or silkscreen so they are very much prototype boards. Theyâ€™re finished in immersion silver. After sending my gerber files over, they confirmed I was in the queue and my order would be processed within 5 days. I received the board 5 days later. Each customer gets three chance to prototype a board before they need to submit something to one of the paid services.</p>

<p>The boards came vacuum packed in a kind of hard plastic shell with bubble wrap, so oxidation and scratching werenâ€™t a problem. The final board looked like this:</p>

<p class="with-image"><a href="http://localhost:4000/images/GoNaked-review/DSC_6261-Edit.jpg"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/GoNaked-review/DSC_6261-Edit-700x478.jpg" alt="board" /></a></p>

<p>As you can probably see in the photo, there is a small amount of oxidation, this was probably due to my fingers on the board although it did seem to get a little worse over the next few days so perhaps oxidation in air is a problem. I did find that the advertising around the edge of the board was a little bit of a pain, Iâ€™m happy for them to have it there but it would have been very helpful to v-groove the board outline just so that a prototypes dimensions could be checked.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this wasnâ€™t a particularly challenging board to produce, next time Iâ€™ll include a test area to max out all their specifications but I doubt there will be any problems.</p>
